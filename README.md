# pageseeder-emails

This is a simple framework to help developers create customized PageSeeder email templates.

For more info on PageSeeder emails see https://dev.pageseeder.com/guide/configuration/emails.html

## Get started

First, you need to update the details of your PageSeeder installation 
in the `gradle.properties file` so that the generated emails use the correct 
email domain and URLs. 

```
  emaildomain=pageseeder.localhost
  hosturl=https://pageseeder.localhost:8443/ps/
```

## Generate the HTML emails

To generate emails as separate files, use the following command:

```sh
  $ gradlew generateAllSeparatePages
```

The generated HTML emails will be saved as HTML documents in the `/email/individual/` folder.

To generate emails in a single file, use the following command:

```sh
  $ gradlew generateAllSinglePage
```

The generated HTML emails will be saved as HTML documents in `/email/all-in-one.html`

## Customize the emails

The actual HTML email templates are in `/src/main/template/html/`.

The XML generated by PageSeeder as a source for the email templates is stored in the
`/src/main/message/` folder. 


```
/src
   /main
      /message    Source XML generated by PageSeeder
      /template   
         /html    XSLT templates for HTML emails
         /text    XSLT templates for plain text emails
/email            Generated emails 
```
